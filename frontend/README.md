This code sample demonstrates how to implement authentication in a React Single-Page Application (SPA) and was copied as a boilerplate from [Auth0 here](https://github.com/auth0-developer-hub/spa_react_javascript_hello-world)


## Get Started
Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the `env_template` file to a `.env` file under the root project directory and update the `<TODO>` portions with your values.

Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit [`http://localhost:4040/`](http://localhost:4040/) to access the application.
